### Hello! Glad you're here 😊
Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I work on bettering my craft! 🔨

- Through my 5 internship terms building customer-facing products, I’ve been able to work both cross-collaboratively with various teams and independently to quickly ship reusable and robust software. I'm always looking for the next challenge and to improve in all things software engineering! 🌞

- When I'm not learning about cool new tech, you can catch me obsessing over shibas, regex crosswords, travelling to all the corners of the world and s'mores 🍫
