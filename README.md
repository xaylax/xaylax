### Hello fellow Githubber! 😊
Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I work on bettering my craft! 🔨

- I'm currently looking for Winter/Spring 2022 coops in backend engineering, data engineering or machine learning -- if you would like to discuss opportunities feel free to shoot me a message @ aorucevi@uwaterloo.ca 💌

- Through my 3 internship terms building customer-facing products, most recently at HashiCorp as a backend/data engineering intern, I’ve been able to work both cross-collaboratively with various teams and independently to quickly ship reusable and robust software. I'm always looking for the next challenge and to improve in all things software engineering! 🌞

- When I'm not learning about cool new tech, you can catch me obsessing over shibas, rock climbing, french rap and s'mores 🍫
